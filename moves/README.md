Move smartly

What
---

Move Analytics. We need to make lots of effort to decide what should be our next move and most of the time we rely on our interest, intution and passion. Be it career move, location move, move to grad school, moving in property ladder, our sample data to make decision is very small and whole process is manual, we consult our family, friends, collegaues, research on web, and trust our intution. 
There is a more effective way, to mine the data of the people who have been through that similar path and how sucessful or unsuccessful the outcome has been and then predicting the next move for the user.

Most important stuff is data, I am eying for open linkedIn data to start with.
