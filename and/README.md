Authoring N Dimensionally

Why
---
When I read book, I feel its hard coded, I wish author would have created more views over the same knowledge.
e.g.

A quick 1 day cheatsheet view and

A weekend learning through problem-solution only view and

A animated/video walkthrough (of various lengths) view and

A reference view and

A audio view to listen while jogging and

An interactive view and

A customized view that asks user how much time they are willing to put in and then generate the content and

and

and .....

Is that too much to ask for, Not really if we could build a tool which facilitates this kind of authoring.
'and' is targeted to be such tool/platform/framework. I understand that most of the effort to accomplish this lies with the author itself but it would be much easier for them if we provide them with a framework which allows such thinking.

Business side of such tool is much more lucrative. 
Underlying content is same but different views carry diffrent utility hence a separate channel for monetization.
