cs is vast in both depth and breadth, To understand and be competent in it is difficult and long process. For that one needs to build a model which would help in taming its complexity. ***everythingcs*** is that model. Mostly based on my professional experience.

github repo is the hands-on face of ***everythingcs***. It has code snippets that will help you get started and feel confident quickly in a given area. Mostly it has toy problems and their solutions.
