Condensed wisdom

What
---
(keyword: Knowledge)
In simplest terms, they are condensed snippets of wisdom to cure ignorance. Spectrum of learning techniques ranged  from Vedas(when knowledge was handed orally) to matrix like future were you can upload knowledge on demand in your brain.
This is somewhere in between.

Think of it as youtube of succinct, self contained knowledge which will leave the participant(not viewer) enlightened with an incremental knowledge. Can contain anything from text, animation, video, pictures in interactive mode. 
Some e.g knowcaps

a. How did humans reach where they are. Sorry I cant create the animation now, but it will like a 5 min interactive animation like shown in attached figure. It can have short quiz and feedback.

b. How life evolved ( C,H,O,N -> protien ->ameoba ->dinosaurs->human ->?) 

c. How mountains on earth formed

d. Tourism: A cool knowcap showing what's must see in Tajmahal. Quick overvew, history etc.

e. etc etc.

you can even club knowcaps into knowpack. :)

The main objective of a knowcap is to make the participant experience the knowledge, for that it has to be short(ideally), focussed(should begin with an end in mind), immersive and with built in revision techniques(if required).

How
---
It has to be a platform to allow users to generate a seamless mashup of video, audio, animation, diagrams(free hand and pictures).

Example Inspiration
---
edx platform is one good example.
