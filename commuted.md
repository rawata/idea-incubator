Commute delightfully

App to share your commute hacks. On average I commute 3 hrs every day. I add flavours to my commute by trying different routes. Sometimes including my walks as part of commute, sometimes altering my route slightly to visit my favourite breakfast joint. 

In London its very interesting to hack your commute, the transportation graph with its purpose built path redundancy provides lots of scope to improvise your commute. Add to that the culiniary variety and walking proximity of tube stations in central London, All ingeredients are set for a delicious app.
I strongly believe same must be the case with other bustling metros as well.
